            <h4 id="game">Yankari Game Reserve</h4>
            <p>Yankari Game Reserve is a large wildlife park and former National Park located in the south-central part of Bauchi State, 
               in northeastern Nigeria. It covers an area of about 2,244 square kilometres and is home to several natural warm water springs, as well as a wide variety of flora and fauna. 
               Its location in the heartland of the West African savanna makes it a unique way for tourists and holidaymakers to watch wildlife in its natural habitat. 
               Yankari was created as a game reserve in 1956, but later designated Nigeria's biggest national park in 1991. It is the most popular destination for tourists in Nigeria and, as such, 
               plays a crucial role in the development and promotion of tourism and ecotourism in Nigeria. It is also one of the most popular eco-destinations in West Africa. Wikipedia
